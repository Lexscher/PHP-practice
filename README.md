# Hey guys! 

I Just wanted to update this Readme, so that it's not AWS' readme.
I'm keeping lines 1 through 6 because they're pretty cool.

I'm taking a udemy course to learn PHP. Hopefully this will help me 
with my summer internship.

I didn't expect to learn how to use a cloud environment during this course, so this is great!


I may update this readme as time goes on. 


#### Thank you for taking an interest in my code!


## Best,

##     Alexander
